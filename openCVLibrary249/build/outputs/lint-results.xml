        summary="Finds inlined fields that may or may not work on older platforms"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases that&apos;s fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and device whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs tbe guarded.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

If you are deliberately setting `android:` attributes in style definitions, make sure you place this in a `values-v11` folder in order to avoid running into runtime conflicts on certain devices where manufacturers have added custom attributes whose ids conflict with the new ones on later platforms.

Similarly, you can use tools:targetApi=&quot;11&quot; in an XML file to indicate that the element will only be inflated in an adequate context."

        summary="Ensure that allowBackup is explicitly set in the application&apos;s manifest"
        explanation="The allowBackup attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup

By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.

This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.

Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.

To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`"
